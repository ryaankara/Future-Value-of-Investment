The purpose of this project is to calculate the user's future value of investment given their choice of initial amount,
interest rate, and number of years.

To use this project, download savings.py and using a comman prompt, run the file.

It will prompt the user to give information such as their name as well as what each amount should be, based off of the
given options.

Finally, the program will display the final savings value that the user would have accumulated.

For your reference, the savings amount is calculated using the equation A = P(1 + r)^y whereby "A" represents the final amount, "P" represents initial or principle deposit, "r" represents the interest rate, and "y" symbolizes the number of years.
